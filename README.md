# Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a large dataset of job postings to uncover insights about market trends, roles, skill requirements, and compensation patterns. The analysis focused on helping job seekers understand the current job landscape and providing companies with actionable insights to improve their recruitment strategies.

# Business Problem
Organizations and job seekers both need a deeper understanding of job market dynamics. Companies want to know which roles are most competitive, what skills are most demanded, and how salary structures vary across locations and job types. This analysis aims to uncover these trends and inform data-driven decisions for both hiring and career planning.
